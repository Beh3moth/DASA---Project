# Data Analytics For Smart Agricolture Project

## Data Analysis for Smart Agriculture in Laying Hen Farming

### Introduction
The "Data Analysis for Smart Agriculture in Laying Hen Farming" project aimed to improve animal welfare and farmer revenue in an organic egg production farm. The project team, consisting of Davide Canali, Matteo Cordioli, Federico Camilletti, and Shakiba Shahidiani, conducted an in-depth analysis of data collected from the "Boccola Allevamenti Avicoli Soc Agricola SS" farm near Mantova, Italy. The project spanned multiple cycles and focused on understanding mortality rates, improving chicken welfare, and quantifying losses in a specific cycle.

### Data
The project utilized data collected from the farm, which included information on various parameters such as date, death count, number of chickens, eggs produced and sold, feed and water consumption, temperature, humidity, and organic/non-organic classification. The data collection process involved sensors and daily inspections by the farmer. Before analysis, the data underwent a cleaning process, which included removing outliers, correcting typos and errors, adjusting production and death counts, and validating data consistency.

### Analysis of Each Cycle
The project team analyzed each cycle individually, employing clustering techniques to identify patterns and trends. Three clustering techniques, namely K-Means, Hierarchical, and Density-Based Clustering, were used. Parameters for each technique were determined using methods such as the silhouette technique, dendrogram analysis, and k-NN distance. The cycles analyzed in the project were labeled X1, X2, Y, Z, A, B, and C, representing different time periods and organic/non-organic classifications.

For each cycle, significant features such as average percentage of laid eggs, average percentage of death, average temperature, and average humidity were identified. Clusters were visualized using scatter plots, providing insights into the relationship between mortality rates and egg production. The analysis revealed distinct patterns for each cycle, except for Cycle C, which had just started. Cycle C exhibited poor performance in terms of death and laid rates, potentially indicating the impact of the ban on beak-cutting on chicken welfare and productivity.

### Common Features
In this section, the project team compared the different cycles to identify common trends and patterns. By clustering all the cycles together, it was observed that each cycle could be divided into two distinct sections based on clusters. However, Cycle C, being the most recent one, did not conform to this division. This anomaly may be attributed to the ban on beak-cutting, which resulted in increased violence among chickens, higher mortality rates, and reduced productivity. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison of the cycles, a spider plot was created, showcasing key metrics such as death rate and egg production.

### Conclusion
The "Data Analysis for Smart Agriculture in Laying Hen Farming" project successfully analyzed the collected data to gain insights into mortality rates, chicken welfare, and production in an organic egg farm. The findings highlighted the impact of organic/non-organic classification, environmental factors, and regulatory changes on the farm's performance. The project provided valuable recommendations for improving animal welfare and optimizing productivity in the laying hen farming industry.
